Source Code: For this coding exercise, I used Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. It can be downloaded from https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/ To open the source files with Visual Studio, go to your copy of the code and open the solution file VendingMachineKata.sln.

Running unit tests: Unit tests are at VendingMachineUnitTests projects. All the unit tests are at TestVendingMachine.cs and if you open the solution with Visual Studio you can run them from Test Explorer, since they are made with MSTest. Alternative, you can run the tests from the command line. For this go to the folder of VendingMachineUnitTests and type: dotnet test
